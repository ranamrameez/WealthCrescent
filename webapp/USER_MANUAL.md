# WealthCrescent — User Manual

Live app: <https://ranamrameez.github.io/WealthCrescent/>

This is the end-user guide — how to actually use the app. For project status/backlog see
`README.md`; for developer/AI-continuity notes see the repo root's `CLAUDE.md`; for the
future-modules design see `MODULES_PLAN.md`. **This manual is kept up to date alongside
the app itself — if a feature described here changes, this file changes with it.**

---

## 1. What this app does

WealthCrescent tracks your investments and broader personal finances across multiple
exchanges and account types. It covers two stock exchanges — **QSE** (Qatar Stock Exchange)
and **PSX** (Pakistan Stock Exchange) — each with its own portfolio, transactions,
watchlist, analytics, and settings — plus seven more modules: Cash, Personal Loans, Banking,
EMI/Loans, Funds, Rentals, and Subscriptions (see §14-§22 below). See `MODULES_PLAN.md` for
the design notes behind each module and any future refinements.

**Before anything else**: on your first visit, you'll see a one-time disclaimer screen.
Read it and check the box to continue — it explains that all calculations here are
**estimates**, not guarantees, and you should always verify against your real broker
statement before making financial decisions. You can revisit the full text any time via
**Disclaimer & Privacy** at the bottom of the sidebar.

---

## 2. Browsing vs. saving

You can browse every page and use the Trade Calculator **without an account**. The moment
you try to *save* something (add a transaction, update a price, change a setting), you'll
be prompted to sign in (email/password, or Google). This is by design — there's no
"local-only" mode where data exists before it's tied to an account.

Your data is private to your account and stored securely (Google Firebase). It syncs
automatically between your devices once you're signed in on each of them.

---

## 3. Switching between modules, and between QSE and PSX

The sidebar's top section is an always-visible **category list** — Dashboard, Stock Exchanges,
Funds, Banking, Cash, Personal Loans, EMI/Loans, Rentals, Subscriptions, Planning — with the
one you're currently in highlighted. Click any entry to jump straight to it; there's no need
to open anything first, it's just a normal list of links.

Inside **Stock Exchanges**, the list expands in place to show a **QSE / PSX** switcher (two
chips) and a collapsible **▸ Pages** list of that exchange's own pages, nested directly under
the "Stock Exchanges" entry — click **Pages** to expand or collapse it (this choice is
remembered). Which exchange is "active" always matches whichever page you're on.

On a desktop-width screen, click the **«** button next to the "WealthCrescent" title to
slide the sidebar off-screen and reclaim the space — a small **»** tab stays in the top-left
corner to bring it back. This choice is remembered, so it stays collapsed (or expanded) the
next time you load the app. On a narrow/mobile screen the sidebar instead works as a normal
off-canvas menu opened via the **☰ Menu** button, unaffected by this setting.

Each exchange's pages, data, and settings are completely separate — QSE holdings don't mix
with PSX holdings, and each has its own fee model (see §7).

The **✦ Appearance** button (sidebar) controls font, text size, color theme, density, light/
dark mode, and **Number display** — choose "shortened" (large stat-card numbers show as
"10k"/"1.23M", with the exact figure available as a hover tooltip) or "full" (every stat card
always shows the complete, un-abbreviated number). This is a global, app-wide preference, not
per-module — change it once and it applies everywhere.

---

## 4. Dashboard

Your at-a-glance summary for the current exchange: net worth, cash balance, portfolio
value, realized/unrealized P/L, total fees, rewards, open positions, and portfolio ROI —
plus a Holdings preview, an allocation chart, a P/L-by-ticker chart, a realized-P/L-over-time
chart, and an Alerts panel (flags positions moving more than ±5%, or watchlist items near
their target price — shown once per session as a toast, then listed at the page bottom).
Click a slice of the allocation chart or a bar in the P/L-by-ticker chart to jump straight to
that stock's own page.

Large money amounts on stat cards (here and on every other module's summary cards) display
abbreviated — e.g. "12.35M PKR" instead of "12,345,678.90 PKR" — for a cleaner look (switch
to full numbers in Appearance, see §3). Hover, or tap on a touchscreen, any abbreviated
number or other underlined-looking stat to see a popup with the exact figure or an
explanation.

The Holdings preview groups related numbers into one column each instead of a separate
column per fact: **Stock** (ticker + company name), **Cost** (avg cost, with break-even
underneath colored green/red against the current price), **Value** (current worth, with
invested and a ▲/▼ indicator underneath), and **P/L** (amount, with the percentage
underneath).

On a wide enough screen, a right-hand rail sits alongside the Dashboard's main content with
two cross-module panels: **Net worth** (your net worth in whichever currency you have the
biggest exposure in, broken down by module, with a link to the full Net Worth page) and
**Upcoming plans** (the next few not-yet-executed entries from Cash's and Banking's Planning
features, merged together). On a narrower screen, this rail moves below the main content
instead of squeezing beside it.

---

## 5. Portfolio

Two tabs:
- **Holdings** — every open position, grouped into scannable columns: **Stock** (ticker +
  name), Shares, **Cost** (avg cost with break-even underneath, colored against the current
  market price), Market Price (editable), **P/L** (amount + percentage), **Exit targets**
  (the price you'd need to hit a +1%/+2%/+5% profit, stacked in one cell), and Status.
- **History** — every closed position (fully sold tickers), with realized P/L.

Click any ticker to open its dedicated stock page (price chart, buy/sell history, and —
on PSX, if you've turned on FIFO cost basis in Settings — an **Open lots** table showing
each remaining buy lot separately). Its stat cards are grouped and color-coded the same way:
"Cost" carries avg cost + break-even; "Bought / Sold" and "Trade dates" each carry a pair of
related figures; if you've sold any of this ticker, "Sell price" shows both your average and
most recent sell price. In "Price range," **Median (fair value)** is a simple fair-value
estimate — the middle price across every price you've recorded for this ticker — useful as
a sanity check when deciding whether to buy more or sell, since the app has no live market
data of its own. Under "Recent updates," click **Export price history CSV** to download
every price update you've ever recorded for this ticker (not just the recent few shown on
screen) as a spreadsheet file. On the stock page's **Transactions** tab, below the trade
table, optionally set a from/to date range and click **Export CSV** to download that
ticker's own trade history separately.

---

## 6. Transactions

The Transactions page has several sections. Each one is a collapsible card, and the chip row
at the top is a *jump-to* nav, not a switch — clicking a chip scrolls to that section and opens
it if it was collapsed, but it doesn't hide any of the others. Only the first section starts
open; scroll down (or click a chip) to see the rest. This applies to every chip row like this
one across the app (Analytics' category tabs, Settings' Account/Data tabs, etc.) — nothing is
ever hidden behind a chip, just collapsed further down the same page.

### Add transaction(s)
Enter one or more BUY/SELL rows at once (date, ticker, action, shares, price) and save them
together. On PSX, each row also has a **Fee mode** dropdown with three options:
- **Auto** — the fee is fully computed from your Settings. Same-day round trips (buy and sell
  the same ticker on the same date) are auto-detected: the larger side pays full commission,
  the smaller side is netted to government levies only (matches real PSX same-day
  square-off rules — one side only pays commission, not both).
- **Semi** — you decide whether *this* leg counts as the netted one via a "Netted" checkbox,
  but the amount is still computed from Settings. Use this when your statement shows a
  same-day netting that the date you entered doesn't quite match (e.g. you logged the
  settlement date instead of the trade date). Every new row starts in **Auto**, including a
  same-day BUY — there's no way to know in advance whether it'll end up being the charged or
  netted side until you also log the matching sell (that depends on the sell's quantity, which
  doesn't exist yet), so Auto's own same-day detection is left to figure it out once both legs
  are there, exactly as described above.
- **Manual** — type the exact fee from your account statement, bypassing computation
  entirely (useful for reconciling against real broker charges down to the last rupee).

Switching modes clears whatever the other mode was using, so there's no way for a leftover
checkbox and a leftover fee number to silently conflict with each other.

### Transaction list
Split into two collapsible sections — **Open positions** (tickers you're still holding) and
**Closed positions** (tickers you've fully exited) — so a stock you sold out of months ago
doesn't clutter the same view as what you're actively holding. Every transaction is sortable
and filterable/groupable by ticker, action, or month, same as before — the filter/sort just
applies before the split, so picking one ticker shows it in whichever section it belongs to.
Click **Edit** on any row to fix a mistaken entry (date, ticker, shares, price, and on PSX the
same-day/fee-override fields too) — nothing here is add/delete-only. The Fee column shows
`(netted)`, `(netted, manual)`, or `(override)` tags to explain how that fee was calculated.

### Cash transfers
Log deposits/withdrawals into your trading account's cash balance. Editable and deletable.
A **Balance** column shows the running net cash you've contributed so far (deposits net of
fee, minus withdrawals plus their fee) — always in true date order regardless of which column
you've sorted the table by. This is separate from the Cash ledger's balance below, which also
factors in trading activity.

### Rewards & adjustments
Any other cash-affecting event that isn't a trade or transfer — a broker reward, a
correction, etc. Editable and deletable.

### Cash ledger
A read-only, chronological view of every cash-affecting event (trades, transfers,
adjustments) with a running balance — like a bank statement for your trading account.

### Dividends
Log dividends received (by ticker, per-share rate, and/or a flat total), see your
dividends log with a running total, edit or delete any entry, and set an estimated annual
per-share rate for each currently-held ticker to see a projected yearly dividend income
table.

---

## 7. PSX-specific: fees, CGT, and cost basis

PSX has a more detailed fee model than QSE (commission, SST, PSX fee, NCCPL fee, SECP levy,
CDC, CVT — all configurable in Settings, see §9) plus capital gains tax. A few things worth
understanding:

- **Same-day netting**: if you buy and sell the same ticker on the same date, the smaller
  side only pays government levies, not full commission — this happens automatically.
- **CGT (capital gains tax)**: shown as an estimate on stock pages and the Trade Calculator,
  based on your Settings' Filer/Non-filer status and rates. It's an estimate for your
  awareness — it isn't deducted from any number automatically.
- **Cost basis method** (Settings → Fees & amounts): **Average cost** (default) blends
  every buy into one running average — a sell can't be tied to a specific lot. **FIFO**
  tracks each buy as its own lot and sells the oldest one first, giving lot-accurate
  realized P/L and CGT. Switching this recalculates your *entire* history under the new
  method immediately (nothing here is stored per-transaction) — it's not the default
  because that's a real change to your computed numbers, not a cosmetic one. Try it, compare,
  switch back if you don't like it.

---

## 8. Watchlist

Track tickers you don't currently hold (or hold and want to keep an eye on). Add a ticker
with a target price and optional current price; both Target and Current are editable
in-place any time (just click into the field and type). The Gap column shows how far the
current price is from your target. A ticker's name field itself isn't editable — if you
mistype a ticker, remove it and re-add it correctly.

---

## 9. Settings

- **Account** — your display name and avatar, sign-in status, cloud sync status, and
  (if the cloud looks completely empty for your account) an explicit "upload local data to
  cloud" button — this never happens automatically, to protect against accidentally
  overwriting real cloud data with an empty local session.
- **Data management** — export your entire workbook as a JSON file (a personal backup you
  control), import a previously-exported file, or clear all local data (irreversible —
  export a backup first if unsure).
- **Fees & amounts** (PSX) / general settings (QSE) — commission rates, government levies,
  CGT rates and filer status, cost-basis method, tick size, currency, and default deposit
  fee. Change these to match your actual broker's schedule.

---

## 10. Trade Calculator

A floating 🧮 button, available on Stock Exchanges pages (QSE and PSX). Model a hypothetical
BUY, SELL, or (PSX "Cycle" mode) a buy-then-planned-sell — see break-even price, current P/L,
estimated fees, and (PSX) estimated CGT — before you actually commit to a trade. You can log
the modeled trade straight from here once you're ready. It doesn't appear on other modules
(Cash, Banking, etc.) since a stock trade calculator wouldn't mean anything there.

Opening it from a specific stock's own page pre-selects that ticker automatically — you don't
need to re-pick it from the dropdown. Opening it from anywhere else (Dashboard, Portfolio,
Transactions) still defaults to your first held position.

---

## 11. Risk Analysis

Under Stock Exchanges' page nav (QSE and PSX each have their own, since they use different
fee models). Models **averaging down** into an existing open position — adding capital at
the current price to lower your average cost — and shows whether it's actually worth it:

- **Current position**: your invested amount, break-even price, how much recovery (%) is
  needed at the current price, and current net P/L.
- **Target buy price / Target shares to buy / Target amount**: a linked trio — type any two
  and the third fills in automatically (same as the Trade Calculator's price/shares/amount
  fields). The target buy price doesn't have to match "Current price" above — use it to model
  a specific limit order below (or above) today's price, not just today's live price.
- **Meaningful averaging points**: a table of "if you add this much capital" scenarios, priced
  at your target buy price — new average cost, new break-even, recovery needed, and net P/L
  if you later sell at your target sell price. One row is marked **✓ Selected** (closest to
  the target amount you entered).
- **Diminishing returns**: once adding more capital stops meaningfully improving your
  break-even (less than a quarter percentage point per step), that row is flagged
  **⚠ Diminishing** so you know where more capital stops being worth it. Hover any stat
  card's label, or a table header, for a plain-language explanation of what it means.
- **Stress test**: shows what your P/L would look like after the selected averaging, if the
  price fell further (a fixed set of drops, plus your own chosen "stress" percentage).

**This is planning support, not a recovery guarantee** — averaging down doesn't guarantee a
stock recovers, and the calculator says so directly. Only shows tickers you currently hold
(there's nothing to "average into" without an existing position).

---

## 12. Trade Planner (PSX)

For planning multi-leg trades ahead of time, separate from the one-shot Trade Calculator:

1. **Save a plan** — give it a name, optional notes, and a **ticker**. A plan covers exactly
   one stock (a stock can have several plans, but not the other way around), so there's no
   per-leg ticker to fill in — just add one or more legs (action, shares, price, date).
2. **Edit anytime** — rename the plan or change its ticker (any not-yet-executed leg updates
   to match automatically — executed legs, which already created a real transaction, are left
   alone), add a new leg to an already-saved plan ("Add leg" below the table), or edit/remove
   any individual leg that hasn't been executed yet. Click any column header (Date, Ticker,
   Action, Shares, Price, Amount, Status) to sort the legs table.
3. **Per-ticker plan analysis**: below each plan's legs, a row of colored summary cards gives
   an at-a-glance read (average cost, break-even, shares after the plan, planned P/L), and the
   detailed table underneath shows — for every ticker in the plan — how many shares are
   already executed vs. still planned (shown separately so
   they're never conflated), your average cost (blending this plan's own *pending* buy legs
   with any shares you already hold, so planning to sell existing stock works correctly even
   with no buy legs in the plan), a fee-aware break-even price, shares remaining once the
   plan executes, and planned profit/loss from the plan's pending sell legs. A "Total planned
   P/L" also shows in the summary line once any leg is a sell — this is the actual point of a
   *planner*: not just listing trades, but seeing whether the cycle as a whole is expected to
   be profitable.
4. **What if?**: right below the analysis table, type a hypothetical exit price per ticker to
   see what selling would actually net after fees — shown two ways: just what's left after
   this plan's own pending sells, and the full position as if those pending sells hadn't
   happened. A quick way to check whether your planned exit price is actually the best one,
   or a different price/quantity would net more — a sandbox for testing exit combinations
   before committing to one.
5. **Mark a leg done** once you've actually executed that trade — this logs it straight
   into your real Transaction history (with an estimated fee shown per leg beforehand) so
   you don't have to re-type it into the Transactions tab. Once executed, the plan row stays
   **synced** to that transaction — if you later edit its shares/price/date from the
   Transactions tab or a stock page, the plan row updates to match automatically, so you're
   never looking at stale data in the planner. You can also click **Edit** right on that row
   in the planner to change its shares/price/date without leaving the page at all. If a leg
   shows **Executed (unlinked)** with a ⚠ next to its date instead (this only happens for
   legs executed a long time ago, before this syncing existed), click **Link…** to manually
   pick which of your real transactions it corresponds to — after that it syncs normally too.
   A pending leg's estimated fee shows both possibilities side by side — "Full" (regular
   commission) and "Same-day netted" (PSX's same-day round-trip rule — the larger side pays
   commission, the smaller side pays government levies only) — so you can see the potential
   saving before deciding whether to time it as a same-day trade.
6. **Delete a plan** any time — this only removes the plan, not any transactions already
   logged from marking legs done.
7. **Collapse** a plan (button in its header) to shrink it down to just the name/summary line
   — handy once you have several plans and only want to focus on one. **Full screen** a plan
   to expand it to fill the whole page for distraction-free editing; click "Exit full screen"
   (or the dimmed backdrop) to return to the normal view.

QSE doesn't have this page yet, but the same functionality is available underneath
(technically shared) if a QSE Trade Planner page ever gets built.

---

## 13. Analytics

Deeper charts across four category tabs (exact set depends on the exchange) — allocation,
performance, fees, and (QSE only, for now) fundamentals. See individual chart tooltips for
details on what each one shows.

**Filtering**: a filter bar at the top lets you narrow the charts to specific tickers (click
one or more ticker chips, or "All" to reset) and/or a month range. Per-ticker charts (ROI%,
allocation, P/L by symbol, holding period, dividends by ticker) and monthly charts (trading
activity, dividends by month, fees by month) respect the filter. A handful of whole-portfolio
totals — realized vs unrealized P/L, cash vs stocks split, fees breakdown, deposits vs
invested, and the cumulative cash-balance line — always show your full history: narrowing
those to a ticker or date window wouldn't mean what it looks like it means (your *current*
holdings aren't a function of which window you're looking at).

---

## 14. Cash

The first non-stock-exchange module (pick **Cash** from the sidebar's category list).
Tracks physical/informal cash — cash in hand, gifts, small informal amounts — as a simple
ledger, separate from any exchange.

- **Add an entry**: date, Cash in/Cash out, amount, currency, an optional free-text category
  (type anything — it's never a fixed list, and previously-used categories show up as
  autocomplete suggestions), and an optional note.
- **Every entry is editable and deletable** from the Ledger list.
- **Balances and category totals are shown per currency**, never blended into one number —
  if you've logged cash in both USD and PKR, you'll see two separate balance figures, since
  there's no reliable exchange rate to convert them with. If a currency has any upcoming
  (not-yet-marked-done) plans from the Planning tab below, the balance card shows a note
  with the count and net amount right there, so you don't have to open Planning to see it.
- **Analytics tab**: a category-breakdown chart, an income-vs-expense-by-month chart, and a
  balance-over-time chart. If you've logged entries in more than one currency, a currency
  picker at the top switches which currency's charts you're looking at.
- **Planning tab**: a "what if I spend on this" scenario planner, meant as a guardrail
  against overspending. Add a **plan** (an expected future cash in/out that hasn't happened
  yet) and see a **Real balance** (from your actual entries) alongside a **Planned balance**
  (Real plus every plan you haven't marked done yet) — a realistic look at where you'd end up
  if everything you've planned actually happens. Two checkboxes at the top let you choose
  which of the two balances you want to see (both are on by default). Edit or delete a plan
  any time while it's still pending; **"Mark as done"** turns it into a real Ledger entry
  while keeping the plan itself around (now shown as "Done") as a record of what you'd
  planned — it doesn't disappear or get merged into the real entry.
- **Import tab**: import a CSV export of cash entries — pick which column is Date and which
  is Amount (a positive amount is cash in, negative is cash out; check "Flip sign" if your
  export does the opposite), optionally map a Category column too, pick the currency for the
  whole imported batch, preview the first 5 rows, then import. Imported entries show
  "Import (filename)" in the ledger's Source column so you can tell them apart from entries
  you typed in by hand.
- **Settings tab**: pick a default currency (only pre-fills new entries — never converts
  existing ones), plus the same export/import/clear-all data management as other modules.

---

## 15. Personal Loans

Informal loans with another person — money you lent out, or money you owe — tracked in
**either direction** in one place. Pick **Personal Loans** from the category list.

- **Add a loan**: person/lender name, direction (lent out / I owe), currency, principal
  amount, date, optional note.
- **Net position summary** at the top shows, per currency, whether you're net owed money or
  net owe money across all your personal loans combined.
- **Click a loan to open it**: see principal, outstanding balance, edit the loan itself
  (person, direction, currency, principal, date, note), or delete it (this also deletes its
  logged repayments).
- **Payoff planner**, inside a loan's detail view: enter a planned monthly repayment amount
  and see how many months it would take to clear what's left, and roughly when. This is a
  live "what if" estimate — nothing is saved, and there's no interest involved (an informal
  loan just gets paid down at whatever rate you type in).
- **Log repayments** against a loan any time — date + amount — and edit or delete any
  repayment later. Outstanding = principal minus all repayments logged so far. The repayments
  list has a **Remaining** column showing the loan's running balance after each repayment, in
  true date order regardless of how you've sorted the table.
- No interest or repayment-schedule automation here by design — if a "personal loan"
  actually has a real repayment schedule, it belongs in EMI/Loans (§18 below) instead.
- **Analytics tab** (back on the main Personal Loans page, alongside the loan list): an
  outstanding-by-loan chart (green for money lent out, red for money you owe) and a
  repayments-by-month chart. A currency picker appears if you have loans in more than one
  currency.
- A repayment created from the **Transfers** page (§23) is linked to a Bank or Cash entry —
  deleting it there also removes the matching Bank/Cash record; see §23 for details.
- **Import repayments (CSV)**: inside a loan's detail view, below its repayments table, import
  a CSV of past repayments — map which column is Date and which is Amount, preview the first
  5 rows, then import. Amounts are always treated as positive (a repayment doesn't have a
  direction to flip). Imported repayments show "Import (filename)" in the Source column.
- **Export repayments (CSV)**: below the repayments table, optionally set a from/to date
  range and click **Export CSV** to download that loan's repayment history (with the same
  running Remaining balance shown on screen) as a spreadsheet file.

---

## 16. Banking

Bank account balances and transaction history, entered manually or imported from a CSV
statement. Pick **Banking** from the category list. No live bank connection (regulator
licensing is required for that, so it's manual entry or statement import only).

- **Accounts tab**: add one or more accounts (name, currency, opening balance). Each
  account has exactly one currency. Edit or delete any account (deleting an account also
  deletes its transactions). A "Total balance" summary at the top groups accounts by
  currency, and shows a note underneath if that currency has any upcoming (not-yet-marked-
  done) plans from the Planning tab. Click **Details** on any account for its current
  balance, upcoming plans, and 20 most recent transactions in one view, plus a "Download
  statement" section — pick an optional From/To date range and click **Export CSV** to
  download that account's transactions (with running balance) as a CSV file. The same
  Details view has an **Account details** section to optionally save an account number and
  the SMS sender ID/number your bank's alert texts arrive from — nothing reads these yet,
  they're saved for a possible future feature that imports transactions straight from those
  SMS alerts.
- **Transactions tab**: pick an account, then log transactions with a multi-row form (date,
  description, a signed amount — negative for spend/debit, positive for deposit/credit —
  and an optional free-form category with autocomplete over your own previous categories).
  The list shows a running balance and every entry is editable/deletable. A category
  breakdown card shows net spend/income per category.
- **Planning tab**: the same "what if I spend on this" scenario planner as Cash's (see §14)
  — pick an account, add a plan (expected date, description, a signed amount), and see a
  **Real** vs. **Planned** total balance for that account's currency, with the same two
  display checkboxes. "Mark as done" turns a plan into a real transaction on that account
  while keeping the plan around, now shown as "Done."
- **Import statement tab**: pick the target account, choose a CSV file exported from your
  bank, then map which column is Date/Description/Amount (every bank's export looks
  different, so this asks you rather than guessing) — check "Flip sign" if your bank
  exports spending as positive numbers. Preview the first 5 mapped rows, then import. This
  is intentionally a simple column-mapping tool, not a parser for every specific bank
  format.
- **Analytics tab**: pick an account (each chart is scoped to it, not a currency, since a
  bank account's history is naturally one account's own data) — a balance-over-time chart, a
  category breakdown of your spend (income categories aren't mixed in, since a doughnut of
  credit and debit together wouldn't mean anything), and income vs. spend by month. Below the
  charts, a **budget** tool: set a monthly spend target per category (type an amount, press
  Enter to save) and see this month's actual spend against it — over-budget shows in red. A
  category you've spent in but haven't set a target for still shows up with its actual spend
  and a blank target, so nothing gets hidden just because you haven't budgeted for it yet.
- **Settings tab**: same account/cloud-sync status and export/import/clear data management
  as other modules.

---

## 18. EMI / Loans

For a loan you're repaying on a fixed schedule — a mortgage, car financing, or similar. Pick
**EMI / Loans** from the category list. Distinct from Banking (which just tracks account
transactions) and Personal Loans (informal, no schedule).

- **Add a loan**: click the floating **+** button (bottom-right of the page) to open the
  add-loan popup — name, lender, currency, principal, tenure (months), installment start date
  (when the first installment is due, not necessarily when you took out the loan), and one
  of two repayment types:
  - **Interest rate (reducing balance)** — the standard EMI calculation: enter an annual
    interest rate.
  - **Fixed total to return (no-interest / Sharia)** — enter the total amount your lender
    says you'll pay back overall instead of a rate; the markup is spread evenly across the
    tenure with straight-line principal reduction, not compounding.
  - **Payment day of month (optional)**: which day of the month every installment is due on
    (e.g. 28), independent of the start date's own day. Leave blank to use the start date's
    day instead. A day that doesn't exist in a shorter month (like 31 in a 30-day month)
    automatically clamps to that month's actual last day.
- **Open a loan** to see its full amortization schedule (installment, interest/markup,
  principal, remaining balance, due date, and status) plus summary stats, grouped into three
  zones:
  - **Origination** — what was agreed at the start: total amount sanctioned, markup
    percentage (the real annual rate for interest-rate loans; an equivalent derived
    percentage for fixed-total loans, which have no rate at all), and net to return (the
    total cost — principal plus every future markup payment).
  - **Current status** — where things stand right now: net remaining (outstanding), net paid
    to date, and the current monthly EMI (can differ from the original if you've set a custom
    monthly payment or a per-month override).
  - **Timeline** — what's coming and what's already happened: next due date, expected
    completion date, and how many installments are paid vs. remaining.

  **"Net remaining (outstanding)" means something different depending on the loan type**: for
  an interest-rate loan it's the remaining principal only (future interest that hasn't
  accrued yet isn't counted — the same way a bank reports an outstanding balance); for a
  fixed-total (no-interest) loan it's the FULL remaining amount, including whatever markup is
  still owed, since that kind of loan has no real interest-accrual concept to separate out.
  Hover the label for a reminder of which applies.

  The Schedule table shows the next 12 installments by default; check **"Show the full
  schedule, start to end"** to see every installment from the loan's start to its final month
  instead.
- **Installment status**: each row in the Schedule table shows **Paid** (already past, based
  on elapsed time since the start date), **Planned** (an upcoming installment with a
  not-yet-done plan generated via **Link to bank**, below), or **Upcoming** (everything else
  still ahead).
- **Edit or delete** a loan any time; editing recalculates the whole schedule immediately.
- **Link to bank**: pick one of your Banking accounts and click **Link to bank** to generate
  a planned entry (in that account's Planning tab) for every installment you haven't paid
  yet, dated on this loan's own schedule. Once linked, the button becomes **Re-link /
  regenerate plans** — use it after editing the loan's terms, or to switch which account
  pays it; this replaces only this loan's own not-yet-done planned installments, leaving
  anything you've already marked done untouched.
- Outstanding balance and paid-so-far assume **on-schedule payment** based on elapsed time
  since the start date — there's no tracking of individually missed or late payments in
  this version.
- **Amortization schedule chart**: a stacked bar chart on the loan's page showing how much
  of each month's payment goes to principal vs. interest/markup — principal grows and
  interest shrinks over time for an interest-rate loan; both stay flat for a fixed-total
  loan (no compounding).
- **What if: extra payment**: enter a fixed extra amount you'd pay on top of the normal
  installment every month to see how much sooner the loan would clear and how much
  interest/markup you'd save. This is a live, unsaved estimate — nothing is recorded until
  you actually change your real payments.
- **Export full schedule (CSV)**: below the Schedule table, click **Export full schedule
  CSV** to download every remaining installment (not just the next 12 shown on screen) as a
  spreadsheet file, with each installment's due date.
- **Custom installments**: if your real loan isn't a flat amount every month — e.g. a
  property installment plan where you pay a bigger amount every 6th month — click the pencil
  icon next to any upcoming installment in the Schedule table to set a different amount (and,
  optionally, a different due date) for just that month. Every later month recalculates
  automatically from what you actually paid, and the loan's remaining balance/months-
  remaining/end-date all update to match. An overridden month shows an "(custom)" tag; click
  the X next to it to reset that month back to the regular calculated installment/date. If a
  bigger payment pays off the loan completely, the schedule simply stops there — you won't
  see extra $0 installments after payoff. Check the **"Link this to a Bank account or Cash"**
  box while setting an amount to also create a matching entry there at the same time (see §23
  below).
- **Big EMI every N months**: for a loan with an occasional bigger payment on a regular cycle
  — e.g. a property installment plan with a larger payment every 6 months — open this section
  (inside the Schedule card) instead of setting each big month by hand. Enter how often (every
  N months, default 6) and the amount, and choose whether that amount is the *whole* payment
  for that month or an *extra* amount stacked on top of the regular installment. Unlike the
  "What if: extra payment" planner below, this keeps the loan's original tenure rather than
  finishing it early — the **"Add unreconciled amount to last month"** checkbox (on by
  default) automatically tops up the final installment with whatever's still owed once every
  big payment is applied, so the loan still zeroes out exactly at its declared end date. Click
  **Generate** to apply it — this uses the same per-month custom-installment mechanism above,
  so every generated month can still be edited or reset individually afterward.
- **Custom monthly payment**: if you'd rather pay one fixed amount every month instead of
  the computed installment — e.g. a round number that's easier to remember, or lower than
  the "correct" EMI — set it in the **"Custom monthly payment"** field on the add-loan form
  or in Edit. Every month charges that fixed amount, except the very last one: since a
  round custom number usually doesn't divide the loan evenly, the final installment
  automatically "true's up" to whatever's actually still left owing (shown with a
  "(final payment)" tag) instead of repeating the custom amount and over- or under-paying.
  You can still set a per-month custom installment (above) on top of this for any specific
  month, including the final one — a manually-set month always wins over the automatic
  final payment.
- **Repayment log**: below the Schedule table, a list of every actual payment recorded
  against this loan (the same data the Schedule table's pencil icon edits, shown here as one
  reviewable list covering every month, not just the upcoming ones). Edit an amount or
  delete an entry directly here. This is also what a linked Bank/Cash transfer (§23 below)
  points to when you link a real payment to a specific installment.

## 20. Funds

Mutual fund unit holdings and performance. Pick **Funds** from the category list.
Structurally the closest of the new modules to QSE/PSX (buy/sell units at a NAV per unit is the same shape as buy/
sell shares at a price), so it shares the same underlying calculation engine.

- **Add a fund**: name, code, "invested via" platform, category (Equity/Debt/Hybrid/
  International/Other), currency, and optionally an initial investment (amount + NAV) to
  create the first transaction right away.
- **Fund list**: units held, current value, net profit (amount and %), and **XIRR** — a
  return measure that accounts for *when* each investment happened, not just the total, so
  it's more accurate than a flat percentage when you've invested at different times.
- **Open a fund** to see full stats (units, average NAV cost, invested, current value, net
  profit, XIRR), update its current NAV (like a stock's market price), and log or edit/
  delete Invest/Withdraw transactions (units + NAV per unit).
- Edit or delete the fund itself any time (deleting also removes its transactions).
- **Export statement (CSV)**: below the Transactions table, optionally set a from/to date
  range and click **Export CSV** to download that fund's buy/sell history as a spreadsheet
  file.
- **Analytics tab**: pick a fund (and a currency, if you hold funds in more than one) to see
  its NAV over time, and a "Contribution vs. value" chart comparing what you've put in against
  what the position is actually worth at each point — useful for spotting when a fund
  genuinely pulled ahead of (or fell behind) your own money. There's also an "Allocation by
  category" chart showing how your total holdings split across fund categories. If you've
  never manually updated a fund's NAV, its NAV-over-time chart stays empty until you do — but
  the Contribution vs. value chart still works, using the price from your buy/sell
  transactions themselves.
- **Transfers tab**: cash moved into or out of your Funds account, separate from buying/
  selling fund units — e.g. topping up before a purchase, or withdrawing after a redemption.
  Log a deposit/withdrawal here, edit or delete one later, or check the linking checkbox to
  create a matching entry in Bank/Cash at the same time (see §23 below).
- **Import tab**: two different ways to load fund data, picked via the chip toggle at the top.
  - **Daily history (XLSX)** — recommended if you track each fund's balance day by day (a
    workbook with one sheet per fund, a row per update: Date / PrvBlc / NewBlc / Profit-Loss).
    This is the richer option: it reconstructs your fund's real buy/sell/NAV path — separating
    actual deposits and withdrawals from organic growth — so average monthly and annual P&L
    are computed from your real update history, not guessed from a single ending number, and
    holidays/off-days (where nothing was updated) correctly contribute nothing rather than
    being smoothed over. Choose the .xlsx file; each recognized sheet gets its own preview card
    showing the date range, detected deposits/withdrawals, reconstructed value vs. any matching
    balance found on a Summary-style sheet in the same file, and average monthly/annual P&L.
    Pick whether each sheet becomes a **new fund** (editable name/code/platform) or is matched
    to a fund you **already have** — matching to an existing fund **replaces that fund's
    transactions entirely** with the reconstructed history, which is the point (it stops
    discarding your day-by-day data), but it is genuinely destructive to whatever was there
    before, so a clear warning shows the exact number of transactions being replaced, and the
    final Import click asks you to confirm before doing anything. When a sheet's ending balance
    doesn't uniquely match one fund (e.g. two of your funds both closed at zero), the app
    won't guess — it defaults to "create new fund" and lets you manually pick the right
    existing one from the list instead.
  - **Snapshot (CSV)** — for a spreadsheet that only tracks each fund's Total Invested /
    Withdrawn / Current Balance (no day-by-day history), a common lighter-weight way to track
    mutual funds. Choose the CSV file, set a single "as-of" date, currency, and default
    category for any brand-new funds it introduces, then review the preview table before
    importing — platform/code/name are editable right there, so a typo or a misfiled row in
    your source file can be fixed without re-exporting it. Since a snapshot has no real
    per-trade dates, this reconstructs one buy (and, if you've withdrawn from it, one sell) per
    fund dated on your chosen as-of date, at whatever price reproduces your reported balances —
    it's an approximation of your real history, not a replay of it. If the same fund code
    appears more than once in the file, each row still becomes its own entry (useful if they're
    genuinely two separate positions) with a warning shown so you can catch a real duplicate
    before importing. Re-importing into a fund that already has transactions adds another
    entry rather than replacing anything — if you have the fuller daily-history file for a
    fund, prefer the Daily History import instead, which replaces cleanly.

## 21. Rentals

Rental property income and expenses. Pick **Rentals** from the category list. Not
discrete buy/sell trades like the other modules — recurring rent received and costs (maintenance, property
tax, management fees) against one or more properties.

- **Properties tab**: add a property (name, currency, optional purchase price for future
  reference). Edit or delete any property (deleting also removes its income/expense
  entries). A net-income summary at the top groups properties by currency.
- **Details**: click **Details** on any property to record lease and tenant info (monthly
  rent, the day of the month rent is due, lease start/end dates, whether utilities are
  included, tenant name/contact) and security deposit info (amount, type — cash, cheque,
  bank transfer, other — date, and whether it's been returned). Fill in monthly rent, a
  cycle day, and a lease start date, then click **Generate projected rent** to create a
  projected income plan for every upcoming rent cycle (through the lease end date, or 12
  months ahead for an open-ended lease) — each shows in the same view with **Mark done**
  (logs it to the Income & expenses tab as a real entry) or **Remove**. Click **Generate
  projected rent** again any time (after editing lease terms, say) to regenerate — this
  replaces only this property's own not-yet-done projected plans, leaving anything already
  marked done untouched. Only rent income is auto-planned, not expenses (those are too
  irregular to project reliably) — log expenses manually in the Income & expenses tab.
- **Rent collection (in the same Details view)**: a simpler, separate way to stay on top of
  collecting rent, for when you don't want to project a whole lease's worth of cycles up
  front. Pick a **Collection cycle** (daily, weekly, monthly, or annual) and set a **Last
  collection date** — a "Rent collection" card then shows the next due date and amount
  (pre-filled from your monthly rent, editable), which you approve with **Approve & log**.
  Nothing is ever created automatically — you always get to adjust the date or the amount
  before it's logged. If a tenant only pays part of what's due, just enter the lower amount
  you actually received; the shortfall carries forward and is added on top of the next
  proposal automatically, so you don't lose track of what's still owed.
- **Income & expenses tab**: pick a property, then log rent income or an expense (with a
  free-form, autocompleted category for expenses — "Maintenance", "Property tax", etc.).
  See a category breakdown and a monthly income/expense/net rollup table, plus the full
  entry list with edit/delete. Below that list, optionally set a from/to date range and
  click **Export CSV** to download that property's income/expense history as a spreadsheet
  file.
- No property valuation tracking or mortgage/loan tracking in this version — a property's
  mortgage, if you have one, belongs in EMI/Loans (§18) instead.
- **Analytics tab**: pick a currency (if you hold properties in more than one) to see a
  "Net income by property" chart comparing all your properties side by side — profitable
  ones in green, properties running at a loss in red. Pick a property to see its category
  breakdown (how much of its income/expense came from where) and its monthly income vs.
  expense trend as charts, alongside the same tables already available in the Income &
  expenses tab.
- **Import tab**: import a CSV of income/expense entries for one selected property — map
  Date/Amount/an optional Category column; a positive amount is rent income, negative is an
  expense (check "Flip sign" if your export does the opposite). Imported entries show
  "Import (filename)" in the entry list's Source column.
- **Settings tab**: same account/cloud-sync status and export/import/clear data management
  as other modules.

This completes the six modules originally planned in `MODULES_PLAN.md` — Cash, Personal
Loans, Banking, EMI/Loans, Funds, and Rentals are all built alongside the original QSE/PSX
stock exchange modules. Subscriptions (§22 below) was added afterward as a seventh module.

---

## 22. Subscriptions

Recurring payments — streaming, gym memberships, software, anything you're billed for on a
schedule. Pick **Subscriptions** from the category list.

- **Add a subscription**: name, amount, currency, billing cycle (Monthly/Yearly/Weekly, or
  Custom with your own number of days), start date, and an optional free-form category.
- **Subscription list**: shows each one's raw amount and cycle, its **monthly-equivalent**
  cost (so a $120/year subscription and a $10/month one are directly comparable), category,
  next renewal date, and whether it's active or cancelled.
- **Open a subscription** to edit any field, see its monthly/yearly equivalent cost and next
  renewal date, and a 12-month preview of upcoming renewal dates.
- **Cancel** (instead of delete) keeps the subscription's history visible with a "Cancelled"
  status and the date it was cancelled — use **Reactivate** to undo, or **Delete** if you
  want it gone entirely.
- **Link to a paying account**: pick whichever Bank account or Cash actually pays this
  subscription, then click **Generate renewal plans** to create a planned (not-yet-done)
  entry for every renewal in the next 12 months in that account's Planning tab — same
  pattern as EMI/Loans' "Link to bank." Re-linking (to a different account, or after editing
  the amount/cycle) replaces only the not-yet-done plans; anything already marked done is
  left alone.
- **Analytics tab**: total monthly recurring spend by currency, upcoming renewals in the
  next 30 days, spend by category, and spend by paying account.

---

## 23. Transfers (linking money between modules)

Normally, moving money between two modules — say, withdrawing cash from your bank account —
means entering it twice: a withdrawal in Banking and a cash-in entry in Cash. Do that and the
two records have no idea they're related; edit or delete one later and the other silently
goes stale. **Transfers** fixes that for the most common moves by creating **one linked
transfer** that writes a real record on both sides at once, and keeps them in sync afterward.

There's no separate Transfers page to navigate to — click the floating **+**/menu button in
the bottom-right corner and pick **Transfers** from the panel that fans out. This button (and
the Transfers action inside it) is available on Cash, Banking, Personal Loans, EMI/Loans,
Rentals, Funds, and QSE/PSX's Trade Transactions page — open it from whichever module you're
adding the record to, and it opens the same popup either way.

**Supported so far**: Cash ↔ Banking (including moving money between two of your own bank
accounts), Banking ↔ your QSE or PSX cash balance (a deposit or withdrawal), Banking/Cash ↔ a
specific Rentals property (rent received, or an expense paid), Banking/Cash ↔ a specific
Personal Loan (a repayment logged against that loan), Banking/Cash ↔ Funds (a deposit into or
withdrawal from Funds' cash balance), and Banking/Cash ↔ a specific EMI/Loans loan (a payment
logged against that loan's next installment). Other pairings (e.g. Cash directly to a stock
exchange) aren't wired up yet — the popup tells you if a pairing isn't supported instead of
silently doing something wrong.

- **Create a link**: pick which side you're on, an amount, a direction (Deposit/Withdrawal,
  Cash in/out, etc. — whichever wording matches that module), a date, and check **"Link to
  another finance (a transfer between two accounts)"**. A second picker appears for the
  **other** side (for Banking, also pick which account; for Rentals, which property; for
  Personal Loans or EMI/Loans, which loan) — fill it in and save. This writes a matching entry
  to both modules' own ledgers at once — you'll see it appear in Cash's ledger, Banking's
  transaction list, a property's income/expenses, a loan's repayment list (Personal Loans' or
  EMI/Loans' — see its Repayment log, §18), or Funds' own transaction history, exactly like
  anything else you'd entered by hand there. It also remembers which account/loan/property you
  last linked to from that same module, so it's usually already picked for you next time. A
  Personal Loans or EMI/Loans repayment created this way is always a positive amount against
  the chosen loan, regardless of which side of the link it's on — for EMI/Loans specifically,
  it always applies to whichever installment is next due (not yet covered by an actual
  payment), matching your loan's own schedule automatically rather than asking you to pick a
  month.
- **Different currencies**: if the two sides use different currencies, an "Amount" field for
  the other side appears automatically — pre-filled from a cached exchange rate when one's
  available (editable), or left blank for you to fill in yourself (from your bank's rate, a
  cash exchange receipt, etc.) when there's no cached rate for that pair. An optional "Rate
  source" note lets you record where the rate came from, for your own future reference.
- **Finding the other side**: a linked record shows a "🔗 [module] → [module]" tag naming
  both sides — click it to jump straight to the other side's own record.
- **Deleting a linked record** (from either side, in its own native module) always cascades —
  it removes **both** sides' records together, so you never end up with one half of a
  transfer left dangling.
- **Editing a linked record's amount/date/etc.** only ever changes that one side — there's no
  single "edit both sides" action. The app warns you before saving an edit to a linked record,
  so you know the other side won't update to match; if you need both sides to change together,
  delete the link (from either side) and create a fresh one instead.

---

## 24. Net Worth

Pick **Dashboard** from the category list (the top entry — it's the same page this manual
calls "Net Worth"; not to be confused with each stock exchange's own "Dashboard" page under
Stock Exchanges) — a single page summarizing everything you've recorded across every module.
Each currency you use gets its own collapsible section (click
its header to expand/collapse, or use the responsive grid to see 2-3 side by side on a wide
screen) showing your real, unconverted **Assets**, **Liabilities**, and **Net** total in that
currency — plus a "By module" breakdown of exactly which modules contributed to it. Cash and
Banking balances, your QSE/PSX portfolio value plus cash, Funds' current market value, and
Personal Loans' net position all count as assets (or a liability, if you owe more than you're
owed); EMI/Loans' outstanding balance always counts as a liability. **Rental income is shown
separately below, not included in the total** — property values aren't tracked in this app,
and the rent you've collected already landed in whichever Cash/Bank account you deposited it
to, so adding it again here would count it twice.

- **Net worth summary card**: pick a currency in "Show total in", and every section with a
  known exchange rate gets converted and added into one grand total, shown alongside **Total
  debts**, **Today's net flow**, **This month's net flow** (money moved in/out of Cash and
  Banking), and **This month's change** (your real net worth right now vs. the end of last
  month, across every module — a stock's price moving or an EMI loan being paid down counts
  here even though it's never "flow") — all converted sums alongside the real per-currency
  figures, never a replacement for them.
- **Click any number to see what's behind it.** Every stat card and every "Today"/"This
  month"/"Δ vs. last month" chip throughout this page opens a small pop-up: the summary cards
  and the per-currency Assets/Liabilities/Net cards show a per-currency breakdown; a Today/This
  month chip lists the real Cash entries and Bank transactions that make up that figure; a Δ
  chip shows a module-by-module table of what changed since last month. Each pop-up also
  explains in plain words what the number does and doesn't include.
- **Exchange rates card**: rates come from a free exchange-rate service, refreshed
  automatically at most once a day (never on every page load) and cached — click **Refresh
  rates** to force an update. If the automatic fetch ever fails (no internet, the service
  being unreachable), or a currency you use simply isn't covered, set a rate yourself between
  **any two of your own currencies** (not just against USD) — the page works exactly the same
  either way, and it never blocks you from seeing your real per-currency totals even with no
  rate at all (only the converted grand-total/debt/flow figures depend on having a rate). A
  read-only table below shows every known rate between the currencies you actually hold.
- **Capital split by currency chart**: each currency's net worth converted to your preferred
  currency, shown as a doughnut for an at-a-glance comparison — a currency with negative net
  worth doesn't get a slice (a doughnut can't show a negative value meaningfully) but is still
  fully visible in its own card above.
- **Assets vs. liabilities by currency chart**: a bar chart comparing your total assets
  against your total liabilities within each currency you hold, side by side — unlike the
  doughnut above, this one does show a currency whose liabilities outweigh its assets.
- **Breakdown by module chart**: for whichever currency you're most exposed in, a bar chart
  of the same per-module figures the small colored "By module" cards above already show.
- **Monthly summary**: below the charts, a per-currency section (one grid entry per currency
  you hold) with a combined bar/line chart — assets and liabilities as stacked bars, net worth
  as an overlaid line — plus a scrollable table of Income/Expense/Net/Net worth by month.
  **◀ Earlier** / **Today** / **Later ▶** slide a shared 6-month window (3 past, current, 2
  future) backwards or forwards; it won't scroll further back than your own earliest recorded
  activity. Past months are computed for real from your actual history (no saved snapshot
  needed); future months are a projection from today's real figures plus your Planning-tab
  plans and EMI/Loans' own repayment schedules — a forecast, not a guarantee.
- **Save snapshot**: click **Save snapshot** any time to log today's net worth (in every
  currency you hold) — clicking it again later the same day updates that day's entry instead
  of creating a duplicate. This also happens automatically once a day in the background while
  you're signed in, so you don't have to remember to click it. A saved snapshot is a frozen
  record of that day — editing old transactions later never
  rewrites a past snapshot's number, only your live current totals above change.
