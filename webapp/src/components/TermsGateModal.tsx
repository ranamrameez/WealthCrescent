 * built on the shared `Modal` component: this one has no close button and
 * no click-outside-to-dismiss — the only way out is the explicit checkbox
 * + Accept button, so it can't be dismissed without agreeing. Full text
 * stays reachable anytime after via the sidebar's "Disclaimer & Privacy"
 * link to /legal — this is a condensed version, not a replacement. */
