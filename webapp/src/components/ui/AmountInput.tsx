/** User-requested (2026-09-08): "allow users to directly enter basic math
 * in the input boxes like a sheet rather than needing an external calc."
 * A drop-in replacement for `<TextInput type="number">` on an Amount-style
 * field — the browser's own native `type="number"` input REJECTS
 * characters like `+`/`*`/`(` outright, so accepting an expression means
 * using `type="text"` (with `inputMode="decimal"` to still get a
 * numeric-leaning mobile keyboard) and evaluating on blur/Enter, not on
 * every keystroke — an in-progress expression like `"10+"` isn't a valid
 * number yet, so committing it mid-type would be wrong. Same "own local
 * text state that holds exactly what's typed" pattern already established
 * for the Trade Calculator's Amount field, generalized into one shared
 * component instead of being re-solved per call site.
 *
 * `value`/`onChange` behave like a plain controlled number field from the
 * OUTSIDE — the caller only ever sees a resolved number, never the raw
 * typed text — but the actual commit (and any downstream effect that
 * depends on the value, e.g. an FX-conversion suggestion) only fires once
 * the user leaves the field or presses Enter, exactly like typing a
 * formula into a spreadsheet cell. An unresolvable expression is left
 * as-is in the field (not silently cleared) so the user can see and fix
 * their typo, and `onChange` simply isn't called until it resolves. */
