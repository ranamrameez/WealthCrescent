/** FX rate cache for the Net Worth dashboard's currency conversion.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a live per-page-load API call (the app's locked rule —
 * see CLAUDE.md's Design decisions) — rates are fetched at most once, cached
 * in localStorage with a timestamp, and reused until stale. If the fetch
 * ever fails (network error, the provider being unreachable, CORS), the app
 * falls back to whatever's already cached, or to the user typing a rate in
 * by hand — the user explicitly approved this "free API if it works,
 * otherwise manual" approach over paying for scheduled Cloud Functions.
 *
 * User-reported (2026-09-09): "saving currency rates should belong that
 * user only" — this REVERSES the original design here (rates were treated
 * as a global, account-agnostic reference table, same category as
 * `appearanceStore`). A manually-entered rate is really a personal
 * preference tied to whoever entered it, so on a shared browser it must not
 * leak into the next signed-in account. Fixed via `clearCachedFxRates()`,
 * wired into `resetLocalData.ts`'s `resetAllLocalWorkbooks()` (same
 * clear-on-account-switch mechanism every per-account store already uses) —
 * still plain localStorage, not synced to the cloud, just no longer
 * shared across accounts on one browser. */
