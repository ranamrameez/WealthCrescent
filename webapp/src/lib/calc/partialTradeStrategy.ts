/** Partial Trade Strategy — the user's own framing: "hold the expensive,
 * sell the cheaper [lots] who fulfil their BE." A blended, whole-position
 * break-even/P&L (what `computePositions`/`analyzeTradePlanByTicker` show)
 * can hide a genuinely profitable individual lot bought at a lower price —
 * a real example: 50 sh bought @10.40 + 14 sh @9.962, price rises to
 * 10.37 — the blended BE barely clears, but the cheap 14-share lot alone
 * was already ~4-5% profit. This module is purely advisory: it reads FIFO
 * lots (`computeFIFOPositions`, already pure/stateless) for DISPLAY only,
 * regardless of a workbook's real `costBasisMethod` setting — it must
 * never be read as implying that setting should change, since that
 * retroactively recomputes a user's real historical P/L (see
 * `PSXSettings.costBasisMethod`'s own doc comment — QSE gained the
 * identical `QSESettings.costBasisMethod` field 2026-09-17, same warning
 * applies there too).
 *
 * As of 2026-09-18 this is the deliberate, permanent "Trader Strategy"
 * view (`'lowestCostFirst'`) paired against the "Official" view's own
 * recommended `'fifo'` default — see `LotMatchOrder`'s own doc comment in
 * `fifoPositions.ts` for the real-world research behind that pairing. */
