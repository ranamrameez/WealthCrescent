/** User-reported critical bug (2026-08-27): `signInWithPopup` opened the
 * Google popup, sometimes even showed the user's own email in it, then
 * hung indefinitely — neither window closed on its own, no status update
 * either way, and manually dismissing both left the app reporting "not
 * logged in." Root cause: `signInWithPopup` depends on a `postMessage`
 * bridge (plus polling `popup.closed`) between the popup and the opener
 * window, on a DIFFERENT origin (`authDomain`, `qse-app.firebaseapp.com`)
 * than the app itself (`ranamrameez.github.io`) — exactly the cross-origin
 * popup case modern Chrome's Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy defaults and
 * third-party storage partitioning are known to silently break. Firebase's
 * own documented mitigation is setting a `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy:
 * same-origin-allow-popups` response header on the app's OWN origin —
 * not possible here since this app is static-hosted on GitHub Pages,
 * which doesn't expose custom response headers. `signInWithRedirect` sidesteps
 * the whole popup/postMessage mechanism (a full-page navigation to Google
 * and back, using the same storage/cookie context the whole time), which
 * is why it's the standard fallback for this exact failure mode.
 *
 * **Real, accepted tradeoff**: unlike the popup flow, this one tears down
 * the current page (and with it, whatever in-memory JS was mid-flight —
 * the `requireSignIn()` promise a gated write was waiting on cannot
 * resolve in this page load). The user returns already signed in and
 * needs to retry whatever write they were doing, which now succeeds
 * immediately without prompting again — a real UX cost, but a strictly
 * better outcome than the popup hanging forever with no way to complete
 * at all. `completeGoogleSignInRedirect()` (called once on app load,
 * `useAuthState.ts`) picks up the result when the user lands back.
 *
 * User-reported follow-up (2026-09): even after this fix, "Sign in with
 * Google succeeds but the user still doesn't get logged in" — confirmed
 * with the user that the actual symptom is "the page reloads and still
 * shows signed-out, with no error either way." That's `getRedirectResult()`
 * resolving to `null` with no thrown error on the return trip — Firebase's
 * own documented failure mode for this exact "authDomain on a different
 * origin than the app's own hosting domain" setup (this app's authDomain,
 * `qse-app.firebaseapp.com`, is different from `ranamrameez.github.io`)
 * when the browser restricts cross-site storage/cookies for the sign-in
 * correlation step — genuinely NOT something fixable from this app's own
 * JS (no custom response headers are available on GitHub Pages' static
 * hosting, and this app doesn't own a domain it could point a matching
 * Firebase Hosting authDomain at). What WAS a real, fixable gap: this
 * exact failure was previously indistinguishable from "this page load
 * just isn't a redirect return at all" (the normal case for every other
 * page load) — both produced `signedIn: false` with no toast either way,
 * so a genuine failure was silent, giving the user no signal to explain
 * why they're still signed out or what to try next. `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_PENDING_KEY`
 * (own `sessionStorage` key, set right before navigating away) answers
 * "was this page load actually expecting to come back signed in?" —
 * `sessionStorage` survives a normal same-tab top-level navigation away
 * and back (the same mechanism Firebase's own internal redirect-tracking
 * already depends on to work at all), so if it's STILL missing on return,
 * the redirect genuinely failed to complete, not just "this is an
 * unrelated page load." */

 * independently once the SDK processes this, so this function's own
 * job is just: surface clear feedback either way. `wasPending` (see
 * `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_PENDING_KEY`'s own doc comment above) is what lets the
 * caller tell "signedIn: false because this isn't a redirect return at
