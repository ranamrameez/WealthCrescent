/** User-reported (2026-09-14): "I ASKED TO LET THE USER CHOOSE HIS
 * CURRENCIES ON SIGNUP: the app asks the user on every new device, which
 * is wrong." Both `enabledCurrenciesStore` and `currencyOnboardingStore`
 * were deliberately built as localStorage-only, per-BROWSER preferences
 * (their own doc comments called this out explicitly) — which is exactly
 * the bug: a returning user on a new device has no local value at all, so
 * the onboarding prompt fires again with nothing configured. This hook
 * mirrors both stores into the account's real cloud profile
 * (`UserProfile.enabledCurrencies`/`currencyOnboardingSeen`, via
 * `profile.ts`'s `update()`-based, non-clobbering write) so the
 * preference genuinely follows the ACCOUNT, not the browser.
 *
 * Mounted once, globally, in `App.tsx` — same pattern as every module's
 * own `use<Module>FirebaseSync()` hook, just for a tiny non-financial
 * preference instead of a whole workbook, so no debounce/local-storage
 * plumbing is needed here (both stores already handle their own
 * localStorage persistence; this only adds the cloud round-trip).
 *
 * On sign-in: pull the cloud's own values if it has any (the account is
 * authoritative — a genuine cross-device sync); otherwise treat this as
 * the FIRST time this account has ever synced the preference and seed the
 * cloud from whatever's already configured locally (e.g. picked while
 * briefly browsing signed out before this sign-in) — safe, since there's
 * nothing real in the cloud yet to overwrite, unlike a workbook's own
 * financial data. On any later local change while signed in, push it to
 * the cloud so the next device picks it up too. */

    // already `null` by the time that reset's own re-render runs the push
