/** README item 19 / MODULES_PLAN.md §7-§8: money moving between two
 * modules (e.g. Bank -> Cash, Bank -> a stock exchange's cash balance, a
 * tenant's rent into Bank and a Rentals property at once) as one linked
 * record instead of two independently-typed entries that can silently
 * drift apart (one side edited or deleted without the other).
 *
 * v1 scope: Cash <-> Bank, Bank <-> QSE, Bank <-> PSX. Extended
 * 2026-08-23 to include Rentals (Bank/Cash <-> a specific property — a
 * rent payment in, or an expense paid out) since `RentalEntry` already had
 * a stable id and needed no retrofit, unlike Personal Loans (repayments
 * were addressed by `(loanId, index)`, not a stable id) or EMI (no
 * repayment ledger to link into at all — see MODULES_PLAN.md §8). Extended
 * again the same day to include Personal Loans now that
 * `PersonalLoanRepayment` has been retrofitted with a stable id
 * (Bank/Cash <-> a specific loan's repayment ledger). Extended again
 * 2026-08-24 to include Funds (Bank/Cash <-> Funds' cash balance) — its
 * `Transfer` field (inherited unused from `createWorkbookStore`'s full
 * factory) needed no retrofit, so this is a plain module-list addition
 * mirroring QSE/PSX exactly (a currency, no per-fund `ref`, since a Funds
 * deposit/withdrawal is portfolio-level, not tied to one specific fund).
 * EMI still has no repayment ledger to link into at all — extended again
 * 2026-08-26 once `EMIRepayment` (see `types/emiWorkbook.ts`) closed that
 * gap: same shape as Personal Loans (pick a loan; amount is always
 * positive regardless of link direction, since a payment always reduces
 * what's owed).
 *
 * Extended 2026-09-10 to include `'creditCard'` (Bank/Cash <-> a specific
 * credit card, `types/creditCard.ts`) — same "direction doesn't flip the
 * sign" exception as `personalLoans`/`emi`: a linked transfer only ever
 * means "pay the card down," so `buildSideRecord` always creates a
 * `kind:'payment'` `CreditCardTransaction` regardless of which side of the
 * link the card sits on. */
